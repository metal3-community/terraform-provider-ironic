# ironic_portgroup_v1 (Resource)

Manages an Ironic port group resource. Port groups allow you to create bonded/aggregated network interfaces for Ironic nodes, enabling features like LACP bonding, active-backup configurations, and other network redundancy setups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a node first
resource "ironic_node_v1" "example_node" {
  name   = "example-node"
  driver = "ipmi"
  driver_info = {
    "ipmi_address"  = "192.168.1.100"
    "ipmi_username" = "admin"
    "ipmi_password" = "password"
  }
}

# Basic portgroup with default active-backup mode
resource "ironic_portgroup_v1" "basic" {
  name      = "portgroup-basic"
  node_uuid = ironic_node_v1.example_node.id
}

# Advanced portgroup with LACP bonding
resource "ironic_portgroup_v1" "lacp" {
  name      = "portgroup-lacp"
  node_uuid = ironic_node_v1.example_node.id
  mode      = "802.3ad"
  address   = "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
  
  extra = {
    bond_mode   = "LACP"
    lacp_rate   = "fast"
    mii_mon     = "100"
    environment = "production"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `address` (String) The MAC address of the port group.
- `extra` (Dynamic) Extra metadata for the port group. Can contain arbitrary key-value pairs as a map.
- `mode` (String) The bonding mode of the port group. Common values include 'active-backup' (default), '802.3ad', 'balance-rr', etc.
- `name` (String) The name of the port group.
- `node_uuid` (String) The UUID of the node this port group belongs to.
- `uuid` (String) The UUID of the port group. If not specified, a new UUID will be generated.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The UUID of the port group.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import ironic_portgroup_v1.example 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

## Notes

- All attributes on this resource force replacement when changed, as Ironic does not support updating port groups in-place.
- The `mode` attribute defaults to 'active-backup' if not specified.
- The `extra` attribute can contain any additional metadata needed for your specific use case.
- Port groups are used in conjunction with individual ports to create network bonds/aggregations.
